				here’s a theory that real adventure only starts when you’re some place you can’t get easily. The kind of
				place that isn’t a tourist trap and where you can enjoy the major sites without being trampled by others.
			</h1>
			<p>After several stopovers and a propeller plane ride, you’ll arrive in a paradise often
				described
				as Bali 30 years ago but not yet been discovered by tourist hordes, nor by international hotel chains.</p>

			<h1>Arrival<br> in<br> paradise</h1>
			<p>Siargao is a completely different world to South East Asia’s usual hotspots. The environment, the pace of
				life, and the people create a truly idyllic setting. You’ll find the locals are smiling and kind, and they
				speak good English. Unlike many other tourist destinations, there are no “tourist prices” here. The locals are
				very environmentally conscious as they know the natural environment is their most important treasure. Plastic
				waste and plastic bottles are not common here, straws were banned way before Europe has even started the
				discussions about the idea.</p>

			<p>Within moments of arriving, you’ll get in the flow of this way of life, where everyone gets around by
				habal-habal (a type of motorbike with a roof that’s kind of like a tuk-tuk) on the roads and by traditional
				boat between the islands. You’ll even take a boat when zipping between the best beaches and surf spots.</p>

			<p>One of the highlights of the trip is heading to the local market to buy all kinds of fresh fish, seafood,
				fruit and veg. We’ll then take our haul over to a breathtakingly beautiful island where a local family will
				cook a delicious traditional meal for us that we’ll enjoy on a white sandy beach.</p>

			<h1>Surfing over a<br> coral reef</h1>
			<p>The island is surrounded by world class reefs and turquoise water. For those wanting the ultimate Siargao
				experience, it’s worth taking the board out. All beginners get their own personal instructor because surfing
				on reef-breaks can be dangerous for newbies. By the end of the trip, your surfing will improve more than
				you’ve ever imagined, and you’ll definitely form a close bond with your instructor too. For experienced
				surfers, the world-famous Cloud 9 surf spot is at Siargao, and with any luck you’ll be able to surf its
				perfect tubes.</p>
			<p> We planned the itinerary so that those who don’t want to surf also have a magical time. We will visit
				lagoons by boat, climb caves, canoe in a jungle and of course sunbathe on the beach. </p>

			<h1>Head to the party<br> in a boat</h1>
			<p>The locals love to party, and there’s always a mix of surfers and locals enjoying themselves at one of the
				island parties. In fact, a party is held on a different venue each night, sometimes even offshore on a tiny
				island, so we’ll head there by boat. Did you know that rum is cheaper than cola on Siargao? Yep, that’s right.
				Ordering a double rum and coke will be cheaper than ordering just a coke. Not to talk about triple rum-cokes.
				Still you’ll want to keep track of your drinks so that you’re ready to head out surfing early the next
				morning!</p>
			<p> After spending 10 days in paradise you will fell in love with Siargao so deeply, that you’ll want to hide
				this amazing destination from others to keep it unspoiled as it is now.</p>
